A simple Chrome(ium) extension to inject your own SRT subtitles into YouTube videos!

Ever wanted to add your own subtitles to a YouTube video, or frustrated by missing captions? This extension lets you easily inject SRT subtitles—either from a file or a URL—directly into YouTube videos. Subtitles are displayed using YouTube’s native subtitle UI for a seamless experience.

## Features

- Inject SRT subtitles from a file or URL
- Customizable subtitle appearance (With Chrome-sync between devices)
- Works on any YouTube video
- Native Integration with my [Sendokai Subtitles](https://github.com/IbraTech04/sendokai-subtitles) project!
  - With this extension installed, English subtitles will automatically be added to any Sendokai episode that has a matching SRT file available on my repository! 

## Installation - Stable

_Chrome web store coming soon_

## Installation - Dev

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open your browser and navigate to the extensions page (e.g., `chrome://extensions/` or `edge://extensions/`).
3. Enable Developer Mode.
4. Click "Load Unpacked" and select the cloned repository folder.
5. The extension is now installed!

## Usage

1. Open any YouTube video.
2. Click the extension icon to open the popup.
3. Upload an SRT file or paste a URL to your SRT file and click "Fetch"

Your subtitles will appear as if they were native to YouTube. For best results, disable YouTube’s built-in subtitles!
